ssh-prompt v0.1

Copyright 2012, Joe Lee <jpl@ireland.com>

Python script to intercept the ssh command and prompt the user for a username 
if none is provided.

If it exists, the file $HOME/.ssh/auth_hosts will be opened and read by the 
script. Each line of the file will be treated as a host that uses 
authentication keys and does not require a username.

WARNING: Using this script will cause issues with git. To resolve the issue,
use the shell environment variable GIT_SSH to specify the full path to the
ssh executable to be used. On a typical GNU/Linux system, GIT_SSH should be 
set to /usr/bin/ssh
